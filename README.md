# Dyeus_Assignment
3 out of 4 assignments have been completed due to my exams this week.
The file is divided between 2 files. The main.py file is used to take user inputs and choices. The facebook account is automatically logged in when 'selenium.py' is called from 'main.py'. User is asked to enter his username and password.
For assignment 1, the user is asked to enter the status message and the status is updated accordingly.
For assignment 2, a random friend is chosen. The most recent post from the timeline is chosen. the program asks the user to enter the comment message and the comment is updated.
